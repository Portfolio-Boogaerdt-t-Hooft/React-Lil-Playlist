import React from 'react'

function About() {
    return (
        <div className="about">
            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>
                This was a nice exercise. I learned more about props and components.
                I also learned about routing and how to make multiple pages in React.
                Keep up the good work!
            </p>
        </div>
    )
}

export default About
